# Enabling the server system-wide!

To make the server available system-wide so you can enjoy it easily, you will have to follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository in `C:/`, you don't have to clone it in your C:/ drive but it will make it easier in a few seconds.

2. Open the Windows menu by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard, and type 'Environment Variables' and press Enter. A button in the bottom right corner of the screen that pops up should say 'Environment Variables', tap it.

3. Scroll down to the place where it says 'Path', select it then click Edit. After that, make a new entry and type in 'C:\sai-http-server\bin;C:\sai-http-server\driver'.

4. Save your changes and you're done! You can now use the server anywhere simply by typing `server.py` in your terminal and it will automatically start up a server in the directory you're in. Have fun!
